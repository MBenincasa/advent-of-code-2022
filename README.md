# Advent of Code 2022

This year I discovered the existence of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and decided to participate. In this repository I will publish the solutions of the different puzzles, even if they will arrive late. I chose to use Python as my programming language, a language I don't know. What better way to learn a new programming language than by solving puzzles?
